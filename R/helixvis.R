#' Quick and easy visualization of alpha-helical sequences.
#'
#' The helixvis package allows visualization of alpha-helical peptide
#' sequences in the form of helical wheels or Wenxiang diagrams. Although
#' online servers currently exist for both visualizations, all currently
#' require entering sequences and storing images individually. This package
#' allows users to create visualizations for entire databases of amino acid
#' sequences in the form of PNGs.
